              Early attempts to ascend mountain peaks were inspired by other
              than sporting motives: to build altars or to see if spirits
              actually haunted once-forbidden heights, to get an overview of
              one’s own or a neighbouring countryside, or to make meteorological
              or geological observations. Before the modern era, history
              recorded few attempts to ascend mountain peaks for the mere sake
              of the accomplishment. During the 18th century a growing number of
              natural philosophers—the scientists of their day—began making
              field trips into the Alps of Europe to make scientific
              observations. The area around Chamonix, France, became a special
              attraction to those investigators because of the great glaciers on
              the Mont Blanc chain.

              in that nature alone provides the field of action—and just about
              all of the challenges—for the participant. Climbing mountains
              embodies the thrills produced by testing one’s courage,

              risk. Mountaineering, to a greater degree than other sports, is a
              group activity, with each member both supporting and supported by
              the group’s achievement at every stage. For most climbers, the
              pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the “conquest” of a
              peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfactions brought
              about through intense personal effort, ever-increasing
              proficiency, and contact with natural grandeur.

          </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 1.2rem;">The Alpine Ascents played a pivotal role in the growth of the greater outdoor community in the Pacific Northwest. 
            Many of today's recreational resources came from actions and activities of early Alpine Ascents members, including the creation of trails, wilderness areas, 
            and national parks. Our members were also critical in the development of alpine skiing in the Cascades, climbing courses in the U.S., and founding the national 
            Mountain Rescue Association. </p>

            The Alpine Ascents Library
          </h3>

          <p>The Alpine Ascents library is currently being reorganized and restructured by our History committee. Our vast collection of historical items has been combed through with an eye toward retaining items reflecting The Alpine Ascents core activities in the Pacific Northwest (climbing, hiking, skiing, conservation, etc.). Titles outside of this scope are being donated to an appropriate home, and the titles within this scope are being retained in various forms. Eventually, we hope to make all of the titles accessible to researchers, but currently most of them are in boxes waiting to be re-shelved and re-cataloged. This process is being carried out by volunteers with limited time to devote to the project and will be completed when they have time. </p>

          <p>Many of the collection remains at the Seattle Program Center. The Alpine Ascents Annuals and monthly Bulletins are held at The Alpine Ascents Seattle Program Center in the upstairs archives. They are neatly arranged in bookcases, and available for research use during regular business hours, Monday-Friday, 9-5pm. An incomplete catalog of the archives can be found here. For historical membership collection, click here.</p>

          <p>Other items are being stored with the University of Washington Special Collections. The Alpine Ascents has a longstanding relationship with the UW, which houses our area’s largest collection of Pacific Northwest Alpine Ascents information. Alpine Ascents members have access to the collection, which includes almost all of the Alpine Ascents Annuals, through a reciprocal agreement with UW Special Collections. To access those documents, visit the Special Collections website or visit them in person at Allen Library South, University of Washington, Seattle.
